**Abstract**

Training a neural network model for recognizing multiple labels associated with an image, including identifying unseen labels, is challenging, especially for images that
portray numerous semantically diverse labels. As challenging as this task is, it is an essential task to tackle since it
represents many real-world cases, such as image retrieval
of natural images. We argue that using a single embedding
vector to represent an image, as commonly practiced, is not
sufficient to rank both relevant seen and unseen labels accurately. This study introduces an end-to-end model training
for multi-label zero-shot learning that supports semantic diversity of the images and labels. We propose to use an embedding matrix having principal embedding vectors trained
using a tailored loss function. In addition, during training,
we suggest up-weighting in the loss function image samples
presenting higher semantic diversity to encourage the diversity of the embedding matrix. Extensive experiments show
that our proposed method improves the zero-shot modelâ€™s
quality in tag-based image retrieval achieving SoTA results
on several common datasets (NUS-Wide, COCO, Open Images).

## Semantic Diversity Learning (SDL) Implementation
In this PyTorch [file](https://github.com/Alibaba-MIIL/ZS_SDL/blob/main/src/loss_functions/SDL_loss.py), we provide an
implementation of our semantic diversity learning (SDL) loss for zero shot multi-label classification.


## Pretrained Models
We provide a pre-trained model on NUS-WIDE dataset, which can be found [here](https://miil-public-eu.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/model-zoo/ZSL/NUS_mtresnet_224.pth?OSSAccessKeyId=LTAI4Fn4sgPQqdeTuWkvpq37&Expires=1623849620&Signature=cFn27nZ9lkiMZC107B8rnKaAR7s%3D) 


## Inference Code
We provide an [inference code](infer.py), that demonstrates how to load our
model, pre-process an image and do actuall inference. Example run:


```
python infer.py  \
--model_path=./models_local/NUS_mtresnet_224.pth \
--model_name=tresnet_m \
--pic_path=./pics/140016_215548610_422b79b4d7_m.jpg \
--top_k=10 \
```

which will result in:

Note that predicted "unseen" tags are indicated by * tag-name *.



## Training Code
Training code will be available soon.
